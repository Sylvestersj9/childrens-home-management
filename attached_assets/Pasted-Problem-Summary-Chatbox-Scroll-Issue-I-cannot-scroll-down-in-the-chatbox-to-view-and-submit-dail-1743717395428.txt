Problem Summary:

Chatbox Scroll Issue:

I cannot scroll down in the chatbox to view and submit daily logs for the selected young person (YP). The chatbox doesn't allow scrolling to see the entire conversation or input logs.

Unresponsive Features in Reports and Settings Pages:

The features, buttons, and functions in both the Reports and Settings pages are unresponsive. These pages should allow me to interact with them, generate reports, and manage settings (such as user profiles, permissions, etc.), but none of the buttons work.

Profile Button Not Working:

The Profile button located at the top-right is unresponsive. When clicked, it should open up the user profile settings, allowing me to view or edit the profile information.

Action Plan:

Fix 1: Implement Scrollable Chatbox for Daily Logs:
Ensure the chatbox allows for proper scrolling. This will involve adding scroll functionality so that when the chat content exceeds the visible area, the user can scroll to see all previous logs.

Modify the chatbox container to have a fixed height and overflow-y: auto; to enable scrolling.

Ensure the chat input area is always visible and does not overlap with the logs when scrolling.

Implementation:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Style for scrollable chatbox */
.chatbox {
  height: 400px; /* Adjust based on design */
  overflow-y: auto;
}

.chat-input {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
}
Ensure the JavaScript function that appends new daily logs scrolls the chatbox to the most recent log entry.

Fix 2: Make Buttons and Features in Reports and Settings Functional:
Reports Page:

Implement functionality to generate reports based on selected criteria (e.g., date range, incident reports, etc.).

Ensure that the buttons for generating, viewing, or downloading reports are connected to appropriate backend API endpoints or services.

Sample Implementation:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Example: Fetch data when a report button is clicked
document.getElementById('generateReportButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const reportData = await fetchReports(); // Fetch reports from backend
  displayReport(reportData); // Function to display reports
});
Settings Page:

Implement the functionality to handle user profile management, including saving updates and deleting profiles.

Ensure buttons for saving changes, editing, and deleting are functional and connected to the backend logic for updating the database.

Sample Implementation:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Example: Save settings changes
document.getElementById('saveSettingsButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const settingsData = gatherSettingsData(); // Collect new settings from input fields
  await saveSettings(settingsData); // Send data to backend to update settings
});
Fix 3: Make Profile Button Functional:
Profile Button Functionality:

Ensure the profile button on the top-right opens the profile settings modal or dropdown when clicked. This should allow the user to view and edit their profile details.

Ensure the button is linked to the correct function and is properly displayed in the navigation area.

Sample Implementation:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Example: Profile button functionality
document.getElementById('profileButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  const profileModal = document.getElementById('profileModal');
  profileModal.style.display = 'block'; // Show profile settings modal
});
Additional Considerations:
Submit Daily Log Functionality:

Ensure that once a daily log is written and the "Submit" button is clicked, the log is saved to the backend and associated with the correct YP.

Add validation to ensure a daily log cannot be empty before submission.

Test All Functionalities:

After implementing these changes, ensure all buttons and features are fully responsive and functional.

Test each functionality (Daily Logs, Reports, Settings, Profile, etc.) to confirm that data is saved correctly and changes are reflected in the application.

Overall Goal: Ensure that the chatbox for daily logs can scroll properly, buttons in the Reports and Settings sections are functional, and that the Profile button works as intended.

Please proceed with these changes and let me know if any further issues arise.
