Residents Menu:

The Residents Menu should display everything about the YPs (young people) in the home. After clicking the "Residents" option from the sidebar, it should ask me to select a YP from a list.

After selecting a YP, I want to see a comprehensive view that includes sections like:

Profile: Personal details of the YP.

Contacts: Emergency contacts, family, and other relevant contacts.

Meetings: Scheduled or completed meetings related to the YP.

Emails: Communication history, emails related to the YP.

Safeguarding Issues: Any safeguarding concerns/issues.

Reports: Reports related to the YP.

Incidents: Incident history for the YP.

Support Plans: Care or support plans for the YP.

Risk Assessments: Risk assessments for the YP.

Key Work Sessions: Sessions conducted with the YP.

Create New Form for Each Section:

On each page related to the above sections (Profile, Contacts, Meetings, Emails, etc.), I need an option to create new entries and add information about the selected YP.

For example, on the Incidents page, I should be able to create a new incident report. On the Support Plans page, I should be able to add a new support plan, etc.

Action Plan:
Step 1: Create a List of YP Profiles in Residents Menu
Residents Menu should display a list of YPs in the home. Upon selecting a YP, it should load the respective YP's data across different categories like profile, contacts, incidents, etc.

UI/UX: Show a sidebar with a list of YPs and their basic profile details (name, age, and picture). Clicking on a YP should open their detailed page with the relevant sections.

Implementation:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// On sidebar click, show list of YPs
document.getElementById('residentsMenu').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const ypList = await fetchYPList(); // Fetch YP profiles from backend
  displayYPList(ypList); // Function to display the list of YPs in the sidebar
});

// On YP click, show detailed profile
document.getElementById('ypList').addEventListener('click', async (event) => {
  const ypId = event.target.getAttribute('data-id'); // Get selected YP ID
  const ypData = await fetchYPData(ypId); // Fetch YP data based on selected ID
  displayYPDetails(ypData); // Display selected YP's detailed data
});
Step 2: Show Detailed Information for Each Section
Once a YP is selected, display sections such as Profile, Contacts, Meetings, Emails, Safeguarding Issues, Reports, Incidents, Support Plans, Risk Assessments, and Key Work Sessions.

Each section should have the option to add new entries by clicking on an "Add New" button.

Implementation for each section (example: Profile):

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Fetch YP's profile details and display
async function fetchYPData(ypId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/yp/${ypId}`);
  const ypData = await response.json();
  return ypData;
}

function displayYPDetails(ypData) {
  // Example for displaying Profile data
  document.getElementById('profile').innerHTML = `
    <h2>${ypData.name}</h2>
    <p>Age: ${ypData.age}</p>
    <p>Contact: ${ypData.contact}</p>
    // More profile details
  `;
  
  // Populate other sections similarly
}
Step 3: Implement "Add New" Forms for Each Section
Each section (e.g., Incidents, Support Plans) should have a form to add new data. After submitting the form, the new entry should be saved to the backend and reflected on the YP's profile.

For example, on the Incidents page, allow the staff member to submit a new incident report.

Implementation:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Add New Incident Button -->
<button id="addNewIncident">Add New Incident</button>

<!-- New Incident Form (hidden by default) -->
<div id="incidentForm" style="display:none;">
  <input type="text" id="incidentDescription" placeholder="Describe the incident" />
  <button id="submitIncident">Submit</button>
</div>
javascript
Copy
Edit
// Show form when 'Add New' is clicked
document.getElementById('addNewIncident').addEventListener('click', () => {
  document.getElementById('incidentForm').style.display = 'block';
});

// Submit new incident
document.getElementById('submitIncident').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const description = document.getElementById('incidentDescription').value;
  const ypId = getSelectedYPId(); // Get the selected YP ID
  
  const response = await submitNewIncident(ypId, description);
  if (response.success) {
    // Refresh the incidents section
    loadYPIncidents(ypId);
  }
});
Step 4: Ensure Each Section is Responsive and Accessible
Each page should be responsive, so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Implement a consistent design for each section (Profile, Reports, Incidents, etc.) and ensure all buttons and forms are properly styled.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Basic styling for form and buttons */
#incidentForm {
  margin: 20px;
}

button {
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #45a049;
}
Step 5: Backend Integration
Ensure all data entered through the "Add New" forms is sent to the backend and stored in the database.

Create appropriate API routes in the backend for handling POST requests to add new data for each section (e.g., adding incidents, support plans, etc.).

Example Backend Route (Node.js):

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Express route to add a new incident
app.post('/api/yp/:ypId/incident', (req, res) => {
  const ypId = req.params.ypId;
  const { description } = req.body;

  // Add the incident to the database for the YP
  db.addIncident(ypId, description)
    .then(() => res.status(200).json({ success: true }))
    .catch(error => res.status(500).json({ error: error.message }));
});
Final Touches:
Test Each Section:

Ensure each section loads correctly after selecting a YP, and all buttons for adding new entries are responsive.

Test the submission of forms to ensure data is saved and displayed correctly.

User Feedback:

Provide feedback when a form is submitted (e.g., a success message or error message).

Styling:

Ensure the layout is clean, and the design is user-friendly with easy navigation.

Overall Goal:

The Residents Menu should display a comprehensive view of each YP, and after selecting a YP, every section (profile, incidents, support plans, etc.) should be accessible.

Each section should allow adding new data via a simple and intuitive form.

Ensure the application is responsive, and all forms are functional.
