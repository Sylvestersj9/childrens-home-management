It seems like you're using a custom backend with express and TypeScript (server/index.ts), but Vercel is not displaying the live preview as expected. The issue might be related to how you're deploying a Node.js application on Vercel, as Vercel is primarily optimized for serverless functions and static sites by default.

To deploy your Node.js Express app on Vercel correctly, you need to adapt the deployment to work with serverless functions. Here's a guide to resolve this:

Steps to Deploy an Express App on Vercel
Ensure the Project Structure Is Correct for Vercel Vercel works best with a project structure where each route corresponds to a serverless function. You need to modify your project so that it’s compatible with Vercel’s serverless functions model. Here's how to structure your app:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
├── api/
│   ├── index.ts  (your entry point)
├── public/
│   └── (static files)
├── package.json
└── vercel.json
Create the API Folder In Vercel, each file inside the api/ folder will be treated as a serverless function. You'll need to move your existing Express app logic into a file in this folder.

Create api/index.ts and use the following code to adapt your existing Express app:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import express from 'express';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import session from 'express-session';
import createMemoryStore from 'memorystore';

var MemoryStore = createMemoryStore(session);

const app = express();
const server = createServer(app);
const MemStorage = class {
  users;
  residents;
  staffMembers;
  dailyLogs;
  incidents;
  eventsMap;
  documents;
  currentUserId;
  currentResidentId;
  currentStaffId;
  sessionStore;
  constructor() {
    this.users = new Map();
    this.residents = new Map();
    this.staffMembers = new Map();
    this.dailyLogs = new Map();
    this.incidents = new Map();
    this.eventsMap = new Map();
    this.documents = new Map();
    this.currentUserId = 1;
    this.currentResidentId = 1;
    this.currentStaffId = 1;
    this.sessionStore = new MemoryStore({ checkPeriod: 864e5 });
  }

  async getUser(id) {
    return this.users.get(id);
  }

  async getUserByUsername(username) {
    return Array.from(this.users.values()).find(
      (user) => user.username.toLowerCase() === username.toLowerCase()
    );
  }

  async createUser(insertUser) {
    const id = this.currentUserId++;
    const user = { ...insertUser, id };
    this.users.set(id, user);
    return user;
  }
};

app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-session-secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  store: new MemoryStore({ checkPeriod: 864e5 }),
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express on Vercel!');
});

export default app;
This file will serve as the entry point for your app.

Add vercel.json Configuration In your root directory, create a vercel.json file to configure how Vercel should handle your project.

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.ts"
    }
  ]
}
This file tells Vercel to use @vercel/node for your api/index.ts file and route all requests to that function.

Update Your package.json Dependencies Ensure your package.json has the necessary dependencies for Vercel to build and run your app:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "childrens-home-management",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server/index.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "ts-node server/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node server/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-session": "^1.17.2",
    "memorystore": "^1.6.0",
    "http": "0.0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^4.5.5",
    "@types/express": "^4.17.13",
    "@types/express-session": "^1.17.5",
    "@vercel/node": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
This ensures that Vercel has all the dependencies to build your app.

Deploy to Vercel Once you've made the necessary changes:

Push the changes to GitHub if you haven't already.

Go to your Vercel Dashboard and redeploy your project.

You should now see the live preview of your Express app!

Final Check:
Logs: If your deployment still doesn’t work, check Vercel's deployment logs for detailed errors.

Static Files: If your app uses static files (like images or styles), ensure those files are placed in the public/ directory. Vercel will automatically serve files from there.
